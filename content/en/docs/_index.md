Welcome to the Green Orbit Digital documentation hub.

Here you'll find resources to help you navigate our systems, processes, tools, and client services. Whether you're a team member, partner, or client, this space is designed to support transparent collaboration, onboarding, and sustainable impact delivery.

We recommend using the sections below to explore our documentation structure:

- **Team Handbook** – Policies, operations, and guidance for working at Green Orbit Digital.
- **Client Guides** – Project frameworks, onboarding packs, reporting templates, and access instructions.
- **Sustainability Frameworks** – ESG documentation, carbon reduction plans, certifications, and compliance materials.
- **Marketing & Comms** – Brand assets, media guidelines, tone of voice, and campaign blueprints.
- **Tech & Tools** – Tutorials and usage guides for internal platforms and digital services.

If you're unsure where to start, visit our [About](/about/) page for an overview, or check the [Community](/community/) section for updates, insights, and announcements.

This site uses the [Docsy theme](https://docsy.dev/docs/) – a flexible tool for creating well-structured documentation. Learn more about organising your content in [Docsy Best Practices](https://docsy.dev/docs/best-practices/organizing-content/).
